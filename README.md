# Gray Drop
## Introduction
Gray drop is a development plataform for all the sytems involved in active control for model rockets, it will serve to develop the fligth computer, fligth softwere, ground equipment and simulations that will later be used for the real deal, this plataform does not count as one because it's unpowered during all of its effective fligth, it is taken by an external medium(a drone for example) to at least 400m, then its droped and stabalizaed until the designated parachute deply altitude.

## Specifics: 
- Swapable aero surfaces
- Safe parachute deployment
- Backup fligth controlers(ON SAME PCB)
- NO EXPENDABLES BETWEEN FLIGTHS
- CHEAP AF
- Can be almost fully 3d printed
- Any controler can take full control if it sees unreasonable actions from the other one.

## Progress RN
- V1 main body **complete**
- V1 Fligth Computer **In Design Phase**
- Simulations **1D rot sim done, missing full CFD**
- V1 ground station **not started**
